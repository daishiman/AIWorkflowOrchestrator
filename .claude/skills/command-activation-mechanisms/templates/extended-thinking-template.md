# Architecture Review

System: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Load Context
Scan codebase structure
Identify key components

## Step 2: Deep Analysis
Think carefully about the architecture:
- Current design patterns
- Scalability limitations
- Performance bottlenecks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Maintenance complexity

Consider thoroughly:
- Short-term vs long-term trade-offs
- Cost of change vs cost of keeping
- Impact on team velocity

## Step 3: Recommendations
Based on deep analysis:
- Priority 1: [Critical issues]
- Priority 2: [Important improvements]
- Priority 3: [Nice-to-have]

## Step 4: Action Plan
Detailed implementation strategy
```

## 使用ガイドライン

- Extended Thinking = 複雑な判断が必要な場所のみ
- "Think carefully" "Consider thoroughly" で明示的にトリガー
- 単純なタスクには不要
